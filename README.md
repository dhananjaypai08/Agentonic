## üìê System Architecture

<img src="./images/Flowchart.png"/>


## Description 
Agentonic is a client-side application built on ZerePy and powered by Sonic, empowering users to create, configure, and interact with AI agents through simple natural language prompts. Users can bridge assets, manage wallets, assess DeFi risks, and identify high-yield opportunities. Agentonic's native social agent even launches tokens autonomously by monitoring market sentiment through X/Twitter analysis ‚Äî executing mints and deployments when sentiment scores cross a configurable threshold, ensuring decisions align with optimal market conditions.

## üéØ Problem Statement

users face significant challenges when navigating complex protocols, analyzing market conditions, and seizing timely opportunities and finding the `alpha` using twitter bots.
The key pain points : 

1. **Customizing AI Agents is Hard**
   - To customize AI Agents on `ZerePy` users need to enter a lot of different things to make the Agent work

2. **Overwhelming Complexity of DeFi Protocols**
    - Understanding and interacting with decentralized exchanges, lending platforms, and on-chain assets requires technical expertise, deep research, and constant vigilance. 
    - Users often need to master multiple tools, manually execute transactions, and stay updated with rapidly shifting protocol dynamics.

3. **Complex and Fragmented User Experience**
   - High barrier to entry with wallet setup requirements
   - Fragmented networks 

4. **Limited Access to Autonomous Tools**
  - Creating autonomous agents that can interact with blockchains, monitor social sentiment, and execute on-chain actions typically requires deep coding skills and infrastructure management. 
  - This barrier prevents non-technical users from leveraging powerful AI-driven strategies.

## üí° Solution

Agentonic democratizes access to advanced Web3 capabilities through:

1. **Creating customizable Agents using prompts**
   - Users can define agent behavior, set API keys, and load agents in seconds.
   - Agents execute actions without user intervention, adapting their behavior over time.
   - All complex transactions are handled by Account abstraction (ERC2771) for gasless transactions

2. **Smart Market Sentiment based Token Launch using prompts**
    - The social agent monitors X/Twitter through `@aixbt_agent` for analyzing market sentiment and finding alpha, automatically deciding token launch timing based on sentiment analysis.
    - Launches and mints some share to your address if the market conditions looks favorable to the Agent on `Sonic Blaze`

3. **Seamless Sonic Interactions**
    - Effortlessly bridge tokens, query balances, and interact using in-client gateway.

4. **Proof of Ownership of ZerePy Agent**
  - Users can tokenize their Agent created using natural language prompts as a Soul Bound Token with its `Agent.json` stored on IPFS network
